<h2 align="center">A secure vault for teams</h2>

There are many password managers available. But their common weak point is
the master password. In a developer circle, where team members keep joining and
leaving projects, it can become cumbersome forthe remaining team members to
remember the new master password after a member left.

We propose to use the GPG keyring technolgy instead of a master password to
unlock the vault. Using our application, the use of master passwords is
completely mitigated.
